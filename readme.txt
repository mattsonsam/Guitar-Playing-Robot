Hello - Thank you for checking out our code for the Guitar Playing Robot. This code was written by Amanda Vasconcelos and Samuel Mattson.
This project was an Undergraduate Mechanical Engineering Senior Capstone Project created by Amanda Vasconcelos, Samuel Mattson,
Matthew Doyle, Anna Gadecki, and Macneil Coppes. The project was completed December 8, 2021.

This code was written by Mechanical Engineers in about two months. There are many inefficiencies in the code - that is okay! We are proud
of what we were able to accomplish. If we were given more time, we would love to make the code more efficient and robust. For example,
we would want to make the function playsong() be able to play Ironman without a seperate function called playIronman(). Additonally,
there are some songs that are too quick for the current code and cause the stepper motor to stop moving and the code to eventually 
reset. This is overcome with a manual override if statement that checks for songs that are too fast. However, it causes the song to
be off-beat if it meets this if statement. Thus, creating more robust code that never commands the stepper to move too quickly would
remove the need for the if statement and make the song more on-beat. Some other improvements we would love to make:
-Strum patterns
-Ability to strum fewer strings, as in Ironman, without needing to make an entirely new function
-Easier song input, perhaps from a MIDI file or CSV file

Thank you for taking the time to read this and we hope you enjoy our project! Samuel Mattson is continuing this project beyond Capstone
to make improvements. Other group members will be stepping back from this project and code for the time being.
